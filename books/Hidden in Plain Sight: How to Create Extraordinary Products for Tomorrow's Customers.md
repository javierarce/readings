What will everyday interactions look like when technology allows you to connect a person standing in front of you to their online profile?

range of distribution, the distance that people are willing to let physical objects stray when they’re out and about.

Whenever I’m in the field and want to get some sense of this big picture, I start by looking in a rather unlikely area—the local porn marketplace.

A center of gravity is the bull’s-eye where we aim to set an object down and the first place we look to retrieve it.

a point of reflection, that moment when a person pauses in order to run through a mental checklist of what they’re carrying and what they may be forgetting.

In India, Hindi is the official state language, but English enjoys the status of subsidiary official language, and there are fourteen other official languages: Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Kashmiri, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu.

One of the most comprehensive examples of urban signage supporting illiterate use can be found in the iconography designed by Lance Wyman for the Mexico City Metro in 1968, at a time when Mexico still had a significant level of illiteracy—with each station having a simple icon such as a duck, cannon, or bell, corresponding to a nearby cultural or historical landmark.

The “Veblen effect” was coined in 1950 by economist Harvey Leibenstein, who pointed out that consumer demand depended not only on the functional utility of goods but also on certain social factors: a desire to be “in style” (the “bandwagon effect”); a desire to stand out from the herd (the “snob effect”); and a desire for “conspicuous consumption,” a term introduced a half-century earlier by sociologist Thorstein Veblen.

The accoutrements of status are about establishing an identity, but they are also about relative identity, and extravagance is one way for the rich to show they have the means to do what the poor cannot. As Veblen so acerbically remarked, “Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods or of services or human life, runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer’s good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities. In order to be reputable it must be wasteful. No merit would accrue from the consumption of the bare necessities of life, except by comparison with the abjectly poor who fall short even of the subsistence minimum; and no standard of expenditure could result from such a comparison, except the most prosaic and unattractive level of decency.”

In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen outlined the social equation used by ruling classes to differentiate themselves from their subjects, and by wealthy individuals to assert their superiority to one another. “In order to gain and to hold the esteem of men it is not sufficient merely to possess wealth or power,” Veblen wrote. “The wealth or power must be put in evidence, for esteem is awarded only on evidence. And not only does the evidence of wealth serve to impress one’s importance on others and to keep their sense of his importance alive and alert, but it is of scarcely less use in building up and preserving one’s self-complacency.” Consumam, ergo sum.

Monetary wealth will always have value, but more and more we’re valuing time as a precious commodity, and the ability to delegate tasks and conserve time is gaining significance as a sign of status. Additionally, free time, and the freedom to use time autonomously, has increasingly positive connotations. This seems to suggest that as society becomes more hyperconnected, the ability to disconnect and stay disconnected will become a more significant sign of status. If it’s increasingly difficult to switch off—to not pick up the phone, to take a three-week vacation—then switching off will become a privilege for the few who can afford to do so.

technology amplifies behavior.

There are many ways to explore current behaviors and to understand how this insight can be used as a foundation to extrapolate the future. One method is to find emergent behaviors, essentially things that people have only recently started doing and that might, if the conditions are right, become widespread. Emergent behaviors can be triggered by cultural memes—like a gesture triggered by an Olympic winner on the podium, natural disasters that overcome entrenched social norms, or the introduction of a business model and subsequent ways to skirt it, such as mobile phone customers who call each other and hang up immediately as a way of making contact without being charged for airtime usage.

It was during our research in rural Uganda in villages beyond the asphalt streets that we repeatedly came across people who talked of sente, of sending money without any access to formal money transfer services, but rather by using a workaround through the existing communications business model and infrastructure. Instead of sending cash directly to Masani, Akiki would use that money to buy mobile phone airtime credit from one of the many vendors that lined Kampala’s Nakasero Market, only he wouldn’t redeem the credit for himself (in fact, back in 2006 Akiki most likely wouldn’t own a phone).* Instead, he would call the phone kiosk operator back in the village and give her the code to redeem the airtime, which she could then charge villagers to use. In turn, the kiosk operator would pay out the cash equivalent of that airtime, minus a transaction commission of 20 to 30 percent, to Masani. No banks, no buses, no taxis. Problem solved.

Data, like milk, is best consumed fresh; the longer we take to analyze it, the more likely we are to lose the thread that connects it to its original meaning.
