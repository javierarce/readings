**The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World**, by *Lewis Hyde*

"if I'm right to say that where there is no gift there's no art, then it may be possible to destroy a work of art by converting it into a pure commodity"

"A gift that cannot be given away ceases to be a gift. The spirit of a gift is kept alive by its constant donation"

---

"[Marcel] Mauss noticed, for one thing, that gift economies tend to be marked by three related obligations: the obligation to give, the obligation to accept, and the obligation to reciprocate."
